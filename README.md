## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
As an enthusiastic data learner, I would like to discover more about the world of Data Scientists as well as Machine Learning Specialists using Stack Overflow data 2021. These below are questions of my interest:
1. Are the demands for Data Scientists/ Machine Learning Specialists higher in big companies? 
2. How to enter the field as a DS/ML?
3. Which other roles are closely associated to Data Scientists/Machine Learning Specialists?
4. Which programming languages and libraries are DS / ML specialists using most commonly nowadays?


## File Descriptions
The working directory includes **data folder** and an **analysis notebook**:
- **Data** folder contains The Public 2021 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results. The enclosed data set is the complete, cleaned results of the 2021 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Free response submissions and personally-identifying information have been removed from the results to protect the privacy of respondents. There are three files besides this README:
  - survey_results_public.csv - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer
  - survey_results_schema.csv - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name
  - so_survey_2021.pdf - PDF file of the survey instrument
- **Analysis notebook** _(ipynb format)_, which is written in Python, shows detailed code and visualises results to answer all of the above questions.

## Findings
The key findings of analysis are summarised at the blog post available [here](www.wordpress.com).

## License, Authors and Acknowledgements
The dataset used in this analysis derives from Stack Overflow's annual Developer Survey, which is the largest survey of people who code around the world. You can either download the data in this repository or from the public source [Stack Overflow Survey - Multiple Years](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
